# nameinator.tk

Just a webpage hosting a simple name chooser. 

## TODO: (if I get around to it)

* include a different (non tournament-style) mode where entries are deleted as soon as they are not chosen
* display what names are remaining after each "round"
* better mobile interface
* scrape most popular names by year from a website as suggestions?
